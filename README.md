# Banking Application

## Description

Implement a simple banking application using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. The application should have the following classes:

1. **Account**: This class should represent a bank account. It should have properties such as account number, account holder name, balance, and account type (e.g., savings, checking). Implement appropriate methods for depositing, withdrawing, and checking the balance.

2. **Customer**: This class should represent a bank customer. It should have properties such as customer ID, name, address, and a list of accounts associated with the customer.

3. **Bank**: This class should represent the bank itself. It should have a list of customers and methods for adding new customers, retrieving customer information, and performing various banking operations (e.g., opening a new account, transferring funds between accounts).

Additionally, you should implement the following features:

- Validation: Ensure that withdrawals cannot result in a negative balance, and that account numbers and customer IDs are unique.
- Exception handling: Handle exceptions appropriately, such as when attempting to withdraw from an account with insufficient funds or trying to access an invalid account or customer.
- Inheritance and polymorphism: Use inheritance and polymorphism concepts to create different types of accounts (e.g., SavingsAccount and CheckingAccount) with specific behaviors or properties.

You can create a `Main` class to create instances of the classes, perform various operations, and test the functionality of your application.

## Instructions

1. Create a new directory named `banking-application` within the root of the repository.
2. Inside the `banking-application` directory, create a `README.md` file with the question description and any additional instructions or requirements.
3. Create separate directories for the source code (`src`) and test cases (`tests`).
4. Both students should work together to implement the required classes and their methods according to the question.
5. Write test cases in the `tests` directory to verify the correct implementation of your classes.
6. Commit and push your changes to the main branch of the GitHub repository.
